        There once was a god from a far-off land, Who settled in Midgard
        disguised as a man. He started a new life, had a wife and a boy, They
        were happy together, in peace they found joy.

        His wife passed away, Kratos mourned with his son, But where one journey
        ended, a new had begun. Faye's final request, though it seemed rather
        bleak, "Spread my ashes atop the nine realms' tallest peak."

      <p>
        They made way for the mountain, Kratos taught the boy skills, Keeping
        godhood a secret, but training to kill. Gods were always in danger, this
        Kratos knew â€” But secrets, he'd learn, could harm the boy too.
