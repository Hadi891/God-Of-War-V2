      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p>
        Starting with the release of God of War in 2005 on PlayStation 2, Santa
        Monica Studio has created seven games across multiple platforms up to
        the most recent release in 2018. Now comes the sequel to the critically
        acclaimed God of War (2018), God of War Ragnarök. Join Kratos and Atreus
        on a mythic journey for answers before Ragnarök arrives. Together,
        father and son must put everything on the line as they journey to each
        of the Nine Realms. Throughout stunning mythological landscapes, they’ll
        face fearsome enemies – from Norse gods to wild beasts – as they prepare
        for the showdown of their lives. Armed with his trusty weapons of war –
        including the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos – Kratos’ deadly
        skills will be tested like never before as he fights to protect his
        family. A host of new abilities for him and Atreus also await, leaving
        room for fluid, expressive and customizable combat in this epic and
        unflinching tale.
